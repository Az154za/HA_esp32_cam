# HA_esp32_cam

Well here's a preview of the project ( More of a guide )
# step 1 : 
- you need to install Home assistant on a container or a vm (doesn't matter if having a self_hosted service ) 
# step 2 :
- add the addon of esphome then add the esp32 cam device
- press the edit button and paste the yaml code
# step 3 : 
press install and wait a little bit then send the downloaded bin file to the esp32 via cables first ( if you want to update after you can just do it wirelessly if you do the wifi credentiels right ) 
and there it is
